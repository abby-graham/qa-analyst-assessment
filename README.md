**Candidate:** Abigail Graham

## Part 1: Functional Programming
- **Time Spent:** 35 minutes
- **Approach:** 
The remove_duplicates function takes a list as an input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements from the original list, while preserving the order they appeared in. Using a set allows the program to keep track of the elements it has already added to the result list.


## Part 2: API Testing
- **Time Spent:** 40 minutes
- **Approach:** To begin, set up the environment to install necessary libraries to make API calls and structure tests. Identify API test points and create functions that make API requests. Run these tests to check if the API has behaved as expected.
